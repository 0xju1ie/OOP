Part 2
War (card game)

The objetive of the game is to win all the cards. The cards are compared purely by ranks.
The player with the higher ranking card takes both cards. If the players play the same 
rank, then war happens. In war the players will each draw 3 cards, placing them face down, 
and the fourth card will be played. Winner of that takes all cards! This goes on until one
player is out of cards.

This program is abstacted into a few parts. The cards are created in cards.cpp/.hpp. 
The player's hands (individual decks), making of the deck, and shuffling of the deck, and more
are handled in hand.cpp/.hpp. The game itself is handled in game.cpp/.hpp, and main.cpp 
just starts the game.

Chnages were made to the program to implement a compact representation of the card class by 
representing the suit and rank as bits in an 8-bit integer.
