This version of Doodle Jump is abstracted into two parts , one being the creation of the window and another being the creation of the details of the game. This was done by adding 4 files, two header and two source. RenderWindow.cpp/.hpp takes care of the time and the calling of the details. The RenderDetails.cpp/.hpp takes care of setting up the applications details and renders the game.
